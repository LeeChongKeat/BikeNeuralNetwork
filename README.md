# BikeNeuralNetwork
Neural Network project to predict the bike sharing ridership. it's required Python and Pytorch skill to implement.
The project is a project from Udacity Neural Network course.

Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can get download the repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git. Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.

## Env
1) Download and install Anaconda
2) Create the environment 
3) Set environment active
4) install lib -> numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
5) start jupyter notebook


## Project Step
1) Prepare the dataset
2) Create Model -> 1 input -> 2 hidden -> 1 output
3) Set the learning rate = 0.1
4) Train the Model 100 times 
5) Predict the new data
